Hi, I'm Chelsea!  
I'm a full stack software engineer based in Bellingham, Washington, with years of experience in JavaScript/Node.js, Typescript, Ruby, React, and PostgreSQL. 
Most recently, I built [Test Lab](https://testl-ab.github.io/), an open-source, self-hosted, dockerized feature management and A/B testing platform.  Test Lab features a RESTful API, SDK's, an AdminUI, and a PostgreSQL database, built with: Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and SQL, with SDK's in Node, React, Ruby, and Python.
